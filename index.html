        <h3> busy me</h3>
        <p> So, days went by. I continued with my hectic life style, busy as hell! Didn't even care to make a follow up on #. I had a business trip a week later, flew back after three weeks. It was towards a year end. I figured it was time to tone down a little bit; after all - it was a year end ( and a good one). </p>
